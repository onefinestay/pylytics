Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Added support for mysql client config files.
- SQL source queries now store the results in memory to prevent read timeouts.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
- Complete rework of pylytics to be more declarative in nature.
- Declaring facts and dimensions is more akin to using an ORM.
- More fine grained control of table and column attributes.
- Better support has been added for non-SQL data sources.
- Pipelining has been added through 'expansions'.
- MySQLdb has been replaced with Oracle's Python connector for MySQL.
- Tests added for large-ish data extractions and transformations.


Version 0.7.0
-------------

- Logging added (including Sentry integration).
- CLI changed to `manage.py command fact`, so beware - CRONs need updating. 
- Automatic view generation.


Version 0.6.1
-------------

- bumped version of MySQLdb to the latest version (which fixes an install bug
  on Ubuntu).


Version 0.6.0
-------------

- added timezone support.
- updated example.

Version 0.5.4
-------------

- added missing docs to release.


Version 0.5.3
-------------

- deployment changes, no functionality changed.


Version 0.5.2
-------------

- post-run scripts can now be specified, which run after facts
  (see documentation for more information).


Version 0.5.1
-------------

- our automated package releasing via Jenkins failed to include some non-Python
  files in the last release. We can't overwrite an existing release to include
  those files, hence this new release.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

- pre-run scripts can now be specified, which run before facts
  (see documentation for more information).
