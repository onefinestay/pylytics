Version 1.2.2
-------------
- Using a fork of Oracle's MySQl adapter, which is hosted on PyPi.
- Updated docs - a recent version of pip is required to install pylytics
  properly.


Version 1.2.1
-------------
- Cleaned up README - most of it was duplicated from the main docs.
- Added --allow-external line to requirements.txt, so it can be installed
  locally via pip without additional flags.
- Removed unused crud from setup.py.


Version 1.2.0
-------------
- Historical dimensions - a __historical_source__ can now be specified for
  Dimension subclasses, which will be tried first when doing a historical update
  of a Fact. If it's not available, it will fall back to __source__.
- Cleaned up tests - removed some old cruft. Added tests for unique constraints
  on tables.
- DegenerateDimension - providing this new column type for storing dimension
  values in the Fact table, rather than using a foreign key to a separate
  Dimension table. Used sparingly, it's very useful.


Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Using unicode for the main internals.


Version 1.0.15
--------------
- All natural keys in dimensions have indexes now - massive performance
  improvement for inserting fact rows.


Version 1.0.14
--------------
- Fixing error in requirements file. Only latest MySQL adapter is hosted by
  Oracle.


Version 1.0.13
--------------
- Making sure that if multiple facts are updated at once, one failing doesn't
  call them all to fail.


Version 1.0.12
--------------
- Improved the output of the 'template' command - Mondrian level types are now
  added automatically.


Version 1.0.11
--------------
- Checking for table and trigger existing before trying to create, to avoid
  meta data lock issues.

--------------
- Documentation and improved project template.

-------------
- Changes to trigger creation behaviour.


Version 1.0.8
-------------

Version 1.0.7
-------------

Version 1.0.6
-------------
- 'template' command added to manage.py. This can be used to auto generate the
  XML for Mondrian.
- All MySQL versions now use triggers to handle `applicable_from` in dimension
  tables.


Version 1.0.5
-------------
- Extra rows can now be added to the result of a query.


Version 1.0.4.1
---------------
- Hot fix for v.1.0.4.


Version 1.0.4
-------------
- Fixes to scheduling, and increased coverage.


Version 1.0.3
-------------
- Dimension table names now end in _dimension by default.
- Fixed minor bug when inserting dimensions.


Version 1.0.2
-------------
- Added support for composite unique keys.


Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Added support for mysql client config files.
- SQL source queries now store the results in memory to prevent read timeouts.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
- Complete rework of pylytics to be more declarative in nature.
- Declaring facts and dimensions is more akin to using an ORM.
- More fine grained control of table and column attributes.
- Better support has been added for non-SQL data sources.
- Pipelining has been added through 'expansions'.
- MySQLdb has been replaced with Oracle's Python connector for MySQL.
- Tests added for large-ish data extractions and transformations.


Version 0.7.0
-------------

- Logging added (including Sentry integration).
- CLI changed to `manage.py command fact`, so beware - CRONs need updating.
- Automatic view generation.


Version 0.6.1
-------------

- bumped version of MySQLdb to the latest version (which fixes an install bug
  on Ubuntu).


Version 0.6.0
-------------

- added timezone support.
- updated example.
- dim_date now creates values in the future too.

Version 0.5.3
-------------

- deployment changes, no functionality changed.


Version 0.5.2
-------------

- post-run scripts can now be specified, which run after facts
  (see documentation for more information).


Version 0.5.1
-------------

- our automated package releasing via Jenkins failed to include some non-Python
  files in the last release. We can't overwrite an existing release to include
  those files, hence this new release.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

- pre-run scripts can now be specified, which run before facts
  (see documentation for more information).
