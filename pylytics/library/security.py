Full security rules for mondrian schema can be found here:

These classes can be left agnostic to the olap engine, but looking at 
mondrian schema is a good starting point.

Security tree:
-Role
    -Cube
        -Dimension
        -Hierarchy
            -Member

        Rules for mondrian:
        1. Members inherit access from their parents. If you deny access to California, 
           you won't be able to see San Francisco.
        2. Grants are order-dependent. If you grant access to USA, then deny access to 
           Oregon, then you won't be able to see Oregon, or Portland. But if you were 
           to deny access to Oregon, then grant access to USA, you can effectively see 
           everything.
        3. A member is visible if any of its children are visible. Suppose you deny 
           access to USA, then grant access to California. You will be able to see USA, 
           and California, but none of the other states. The totals against USA will 
           still reflect all states, however. If the parent HierarchyGrant specifies a 
           top level, only the parents equal or below this level will be visible. 
           Similarly, if a bottom level is specified, only the children above or equal 
           to the level are visible.
        4. Member grants don't override the hierarchy grant's top- and bottom-levels. 
           If you set topLevel="[Store].[Store State]", and grant access to California, 
           you won't be able to see USA. Member grants do not override the topLevel and 
           bottomLevel attributes. You can grant or deny access to a member of any level, 
           but the top and bottom constraints have precedence on the explicit member grants.
