Creating a new pylytics project
===============================
Create a virtual environment and activate it. Then install pylytics::

    pip install pylytics

This installation adds pylytics-admin.py to the path. Use this to create a new pylytics project::

    pylytics-admin.py my_project_name

This creates the my_project_name folder in the current directory, with a skeleton project inside.
