pylytics
========

Introduction
************
This is a set of Python libraries that allow you to build and manage a `star schema <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema>`_ in MySQL.

The star schema is a simple approach to data warehousing, which is suited to mid-size data problems.


MySQL
-----

Pylytics has been tested with MySQL versions 5.5.37 and 5.6.5. The recommended version is 5.6.5.


Installation
************

Pylytics uses Oracle's MySQL adapter, which isn't hosted on PyPi:

    pip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python pylytics
